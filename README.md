#  D0rkHub :skull: 
**<sub>The d0rkhub  </sub>** <sub>d0rkhub is a tool developed in python created to exploit vulnerabilities using the google search engine that loads a txt payload with
commands that manipulate google, returning urls vulnerable to exploits. **d0rkhub** was developed exclusively for educational purposes and should not be used for
break the law of any country. </sub>

<sub>(d0rkhub is very simple to use, but let's go step by step.) <br>
"baby steps.."</sub>
<br>
<br>


- **1 - Menu options**<br>
<sub>When you running the code maybe you should see a menu like the one below, with options from 1 until 5. <br> **Option 1:** Option 1 will run the code normally and perform queries by url using dorks. <br> **Option 2:** Option 2 will allow you to view all queries saved within a database.<br>**Option 3:** Option 3 will allow you to delete all stored data.<br>**Option 4 :** option 4 will allow you to view all payloads contained in payloads.txt inside the "program" folder.<br>**Option 5:** Option 5 will terminate the code. </sub><br>

- **2 - Payloads**<br>

![file_txt_dorks_folder](https://github.com/gabrielsatoshi/d0rkhub/assets/112598996/3ea978f0-5af6-45c2-9268-151511ac633f)

<sub>  If you already have a target domain, now you must configure your txt file,<br> which is already inside the d0rkhub folder, the file name is <kbd>dorks.txt</kbd>.</sub>
<br><br>

#  

- **2.1 - Viewing the content**<br>
  <sub>
You can view the dorks that are already placed inside the txt using <br>the command prompt as in the example:</sub>

#

- **2.2 - Changing the content**<br>
  <sub > After viewing the txt content, you can simply open it and <br> modify it by adding new payloads.</sub>
    <br> <br>
    
![dorks_example](https://github.com/gabrielsatoshi/d0rkhub/assets/112598996/2dd15332-7dfd-4537-b2cd-5d761f30198e)
    

<p align="center">
  <kbd>PLEASE, DON'T FORGET THE COMMAS TO SEPARATE EACH PAYLOAD!</kbd><br>

</p>


- **3 - running the script**<br><br>
  <sub > When opening the tool you can find the first functionality right away, which asks if you want to read the txt file where the saved payloads are, if you edited the txt recently, I recommend you to check the payloads by typing "y", so you can have sure that the txt file was indeed changed and processed by the program.</sub>

- **3 - Example**<br><br>

<br>

- **4 - Using a domain**<br>
  <sub > Remember the first step? now you must use it, for that insert the target domain.</sub>
